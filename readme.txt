This model aims to measure somatic firing rate
responses to correlated synaptic activity for Hodgkin-Huxley
(HH) or integrate-and-fire (IF) point neuron and for multi-compartment HH or IF neuron with passive or active dendrite.


This model is written in Python 3 language using Brian2 neuronal simulator.



How to run it?
--------------------------------------------------------

To run it one has to install Brian2 simulator
https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

To run simulation of HH neuron
run corr_HH.py


To run simulation of IF neuron
run corr_IF.py


All parameters like morphology, number of synapses etc. are set in corr_HH.py and corr_IF.py.
One can scan over different paramenters (input rates, synaptic conductances, dendritic channel densities etc.). 
Results are somatic firing responses for increasing correlation of synaptic input.  


Correlated synaptic input is generated by
inputs.py.
